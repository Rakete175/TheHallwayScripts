# THProxyDetector
"TheHallway's Proxy Detector"

## About
* This is a Python script for [piqueserver](https://github.com/lokka30/THProxyDetector/issues), an Ace of Spades 'classic' server. This is designed to kick players that join with a proxy.
* Originally created for [The Hallway](https://discord.gg/ButndsdGua), a CTF server with the original 'hallway' map by izzy.

## Requirements:
* [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver)
* **Requests**: `pip install requests` - this is installed on most systems anyways

## Warning:
* This script was designed for [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver), it is unlikely to run on PySnip or PySpades. (you should upgrade to piqueserver anyways)
* This script was designed for Linux systems, and only tested on Ubuntu.

## Support:
- Please create an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lokka30/THProxyDetector/issues).
