# TheHallway's Scripts
* These are Python scripts created for [piqueserver](https://github.com/lokka30/THProxyDetector/issues), an Ace of Spades 'classic' server implementation.
* These scripts are created by and run on [The Hallway](https://discord.gg/ButndsdGua), a CTF server with the original 'hallway' map by izzy.
* Fellow server owners are free to install these scripts and adapt them as they wish, since all are licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/lokka30/TheHallwayScripts/blob/main/LICENSE).

"TheHallway's Proxy Detector"

### About
* This is designed to kick players that join with a proxy.

### Requirements:
* [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver)
* This script should work on most operating systems - ideally use a Linux distro like Ubuntu.
* **Requests**: `pip install requests` - this is installed on most systems anyways

### Warning:
* This script was designed for [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver), it is unlikely to run on PySnip or PySpades. (you should upgrade to piqueserver anyways)
